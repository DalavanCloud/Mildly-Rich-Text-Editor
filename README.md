## Introduction
**Mildly Rich Text Editor (mRTE)** is a library providing rich text capability for your Android
applications.

## Sources
Code for mRTE was adapted from DroidWriter, which is available here:
https://github.com/agungsijawir/droid-writer. Description is available here:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/droid-writer

## Goal
mRTE is in its infancy and is a continual work-in-progress. Its code has been made freely available
in the hopes of tapping into the diversity and knowledge of the open-source community. Ideally,
mRTE will support features beyond bold, italics, and underline.

## Stability
Mildly Rich Text Editor has been tested on Android devices running API >= 19. It has not been tested
on devices running API < 19.

## Usage
We will be supporting the ability to import the library directly into your Android project via
GitHub. Stay tuned.

## Coming Soon
- We will be supporting the ability to import the library directly into your Android project via
GitHub. Stay tuned.
- Bold, italics and underline are currently supported. We will be working on supporting additional features.
